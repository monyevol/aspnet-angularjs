<h2 class="bold sub-title common-font blue">Traffic Violations</h2>

<p><span class="bold">A Violation:</span> A violation is the act of breaking the law against one or more of the rules that regulate the circulation of cars on our roads. One example is a car that doesn't completely stop at a clearly posted Stop Sign. Another violation occurs when a vehicle drives through a flashing red light.</p>

<p><span class="bold">An Infraction:</span> The Traffic Tickets System (TTS) relies of sensitive and accurate traffic cameras positioned on certain roads of our county to monitor roads traffic. When a vehicle violates a certain rule, a traffic camera may take a steady photo and/or shoot a short video. At one time, a TTS panel (a group of people) reviews the photo(s) and/or video(s) to validate, approve, or reject the image(s).</p>

<p><span class="bold">A Citation:</span> Upon reviewing the results of a traffic violation (photo(s) and/video(s)), a panel of TTS technicians makes a decision. If there is conclusive evidence of a violation, a citation is sent to the home address of the vehicle.</p>
