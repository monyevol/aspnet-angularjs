<h2 class="bold sub-title common-font blue">Cars - Vehicles</h2>

<p><span class="bold">Sharing a Road:</span> The roads of our county are filled with many cars varying in categories of size, weight, speed, technologies, and type of use, etc. Probably the most important aspect to understand is that, on the road, a vehicle is renting, or rather sharing, a road with fellow drivers and sometimes non-attentive pedestrians.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Road Features:</span> The roads within our county are in different categories, including streets, roads, courts, avenues, boulevards, state highways, and interstates, etc. Of course, some roads are in better shapes than others. These aspects and other situations create interesting bonds among the cars that travel them, the people who visit them, and the environment.</p>

<p>We invite our residents and guests to make better use of their vehicles and roads.</p>
