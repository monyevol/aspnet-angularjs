<h2 class="bold sub-title common-font blue">Drivers - Cars Owners</h2>

<p><span class="bold">Description:</span> Our primary goal in this county is to have safe, concerned, comfortable, but especially responsible drivers. We have street signs everywhere to keep our citizens alert. While our roads provide you with convenient ways to move around the county, we also urge our drivers and multiple vehicle operators to be considerate not only of their environment and surrounding but also of other people whether they are pedestrians or are driving. Consider that the roads are yours to share.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Contact Us:</span> If you have any issue or concerns about our traffic cameras or the traffic ticketing system, please don't hesitate to contact us. You can contact us individually, as a group, as an organization, or by an authority of your choice, by phone, email, a form on our Web site, or a mailed letter.</p>
